	The tutorial from the internet was a tutorial to make a simple PONG game. I took some examples from that and re-did the structs and memory access to make it a 
	fully 3D environment.
	
	Rough memory layout for the GBA:
	0x00000000 - 0x00003FFF - 16 KB System ROM (executable, but not readable)
	0x02000000 - 0x02030000 - 256 KB EWRAM (general purpose RAM external to the CPU)
	0x03000000 - 0x03007FFF - 32 KB IWRAM (general purpose RAM internal to the CPU)
	0x04000000 - 0x040003FF - I/O Registers
	0x05000000 - 0x050003FF - 1 KB Colour Palette RAM
	0x06000000 - 0x06017FFF - 96 KB VRAM (Video RAM)
	0x07000000 - 0x070003FF - 1 KB OAM RAM (Object Attribute Memory â€” discussed later)
	0x08000000 - 0x???????? - Game Pak ROM (0 to 32 MB)
	0x0E000000 - 0x???????? - Game Pak RAM
